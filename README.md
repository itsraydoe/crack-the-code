# 🔐 Crack the Code

Welcome to **Crack the Code** — a daily, vault-themed guessing game powered by the **Sui blockchain** and integrated with **Slush Wallet**.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Each day, a secret 4-digit code is generated and securely stored on-chain using **Sui's Seal (DSM)**. Players have **one chance per day** to guess the code.

If no one cracks the code, the prize pool rolls over to the next day, growing larger — until someone finally unlocks it and wins **the entire jackpot**.

> 💰 90% of the prize goes to the winner, 10% goes to the vault operator.
